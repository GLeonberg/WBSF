Relative Strength Index is an indicator for a stock being overbought/sold. Overbought means that the stock is overvalued and is not worth its current price. Likewise, oversold means that the stock is undervalued and its price should increase. When the RSI line is above 70%, the stock has been overbought, and we recommend that you sell the stock. Similarly, when when the RSI line is below 30%, the stock has been oversold, and we recommend that you buy the stock.
